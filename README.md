# Too Human Skill Calculator

Originally developed without source control in 2008/2009, this Java app allows the user to build skill breakdowns for each of the 5 character classes and 2 "alignments" available in the Xbox 360 game Too Human (published by Microsoft and developed by Silicon Knights).

The app requires Java, was originally developed and tested again Java 1.8.

Software provided as-is, and the code is of questionable quality. It is available here on GitHub as a curiousity.
