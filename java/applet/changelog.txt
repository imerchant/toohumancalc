Version 2.2
* Updated with new character point total of 95. Also the level calculator had to be re-written.
* New loading screen with loading details.
* Can now save/load a file with all five classes. Still supports single-class files.

Version 2.1
* Optimization and bugfixes.
* Small change to the Human ruiner node. Previous information based on the wiki was wrong. (That is, that the node increased Ruiner range and damage. It really only increases range.)

Version 2.0
* Redesigned layout very similar to the actual trees in-game.
* Updated all class and skill details (titles, stats, descriptions) based on the recently released Too Human demo.
* Should display much better on none-widescreen displays. I still recommend full-screening it, though.
* Click or use the mouse wheel to add or remove points from skills.
* No longer can you add more than 107 points to the trees.

Version 1.0
* BioEngineer stats now match up with the demo.
* Now works on Macs!! (Big thanks to Mark!)
* Class/Alignment icons now in a better place.
* Smaller left pane to allow more screen space for the trees.
