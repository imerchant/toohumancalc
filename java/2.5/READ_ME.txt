Java program designed to simulate the skill and alignment trees from the
Xbox 360 video game Too Human, developed by Silicon Knights and published
by Microsoft. They retain all their trademarks and copyrights to it.

REQUIRES JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT. Latest (1.6) is recommended, but will
probably work in 1.5. The program will run on any system with Java
installed, regardless of operating system.

To run the program, save the JAR (TooHumanCalc.jar) it will run like an
executable. If Java is installed correctly the program should run just fine.
Make sure to save the file as .jar; do not decompress/unzip the archive.

Please report any bugs you encounter.

================================
Note to Internet Explorer users:
================================
When saving the plotter (TooHumanCalc.jar), save the file as a .jar. IE
sometimes wants to change the filetype to .zip or something else. THE
PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK IN THIS CASE. The filetype must be .jar.

Changelog:
==========

Version 2.5
* Small bug fixes.
* Added some icons from the Tango Desktop Project
  (http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project). Really more an
  aesthetic choice.

Version 2.4
* Bugfix: Hitting "Reset" didn't clear some points, preventing full
  builds from being made. App had to be restarted to fix the problem. I
  changed how the reset function works, I believe it is fixed now.
* Updated the skill details using the retail version of the game.
  Commando tree, and both Alignment trees contain the heaviest changes.

Version 2.3
* Added progression bar to the trees. Shows percent of available points
  used. Can be hidden.
* New options menu. Only one so far, but hoping for more.
* Some optimization changes.
* Alt-clicks provide more input options. See help.

Version 2.2
* Updated with new character point total of 95. Also the level calculator
  had to be re-written.
* New loading screen with loading details.
* Can now save/load a file with all five classes. Still supports
  single-class files.

Version 2.1
* Optimization and bugfixes.
* Small change to the Human ruiner node. Previous information based on
  the wiki was wrong. (That is, that the node increased Ruiner range and
  damage. It really only increases range.)

Version 2.0
* Redesigned layout very similar to the actual trees in-game.
* Updated all class and skill details (titles, stats, descriptions) based
  on the recently released Too Human demo.
* Should display much better on none-widescreen displays. I still
  recommend full-screening it, though.
* Click or use the mouse wheel to add or remove points from skills.
* No longer can you add more than 107 points to the trees.

Version 1.0
* BioEngineer stats now match up with the demo.
* Now works on Macs!! (Big thanks to Mark!)
* Class/Alignment icons now in a better place.
* Smaller left pane to allow more screen space for the trees.

  from the Too Human wiki
